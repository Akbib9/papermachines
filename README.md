Paper Machines is an open-source extension for the Zotero bibliographic management software. Its purpose is to allow researchers to generate analyses and visualizations of their corpora, without requiring extensive computational resources or technical knowledge.

This version, 0.5.0, is primarily a wrapper around [papermachines-server](https://github.com/chrisjr/papermachines-server).
